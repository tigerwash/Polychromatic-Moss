# Polychromatic-Moss
Cellular automation defines a world standing in between clear rule and ambiguity. The rule is that every individual’s presence depends only on it's previous surviving state and adjacent the neighborhood which cannot be either too packed or too desolate in order to the subject alive. Such rule determines that the global behaviors depend only on its local interactions but can still create surprisingly variable and at the same time seemingly predictable ‘patterns ’.

By manipulating the local rules and global influences, we create a self-organized surface system that follows any surface and adjusts itself when its population drops down dramatically or is approaching convergence. Simple cellular geometries are created to be mapped into the system and to reflect the surviving states of each cell. As the color indicates, every surviving cell has its distinct character.
